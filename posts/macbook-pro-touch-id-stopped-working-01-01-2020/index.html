      <h1>MacBook Pro Touch ID stopped working</h1>

<p>As a developer, you often end up in the issues related to the development environment. I use the <strong>MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019)</strong> model for my development activities and configured Touch ID for unlocking my Mac. Everything was well until I changed my Mac password. From then on, I had to manually type my password every time to unlock Mac as the Touch ID stopped working.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution <a class="direct-link" href="#solution">#</a></h2>
<p>The solution that worked for me was to reset Mac SMC (System Management Controller).</p>
<p>What is SMC?</p>
<p>The SMC is responsible for hardware and other low-level functions on Intel-based Mac computers</p>
<p>How to reset SMC on Mac?</p>
<p>The procedure is different based on the Mac model.</p>
<p>For MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019), press <strong>Shift + Control + Option</strong> on the left side of the built-in keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10-20 seconds.</p>
<p>For other models see the <a href="#links">Links</a></p>
<hr>
<p>After resetting SMC, I had to set up my Touch ID again.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm able to use my Touch ID  üòÉ</p>
